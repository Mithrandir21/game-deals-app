  Hunt for memory leaks and lifecycle violations in Android code: Activity/Fragment/View/Context
  references held past their lifecycle, ViewBinding accessed after onDestroyView, listeners

# Lifecycle Leak Hunter

## Purpose

Memory leaks on Android almost always come from a small set of patterns: holding a reference
to something with a short lifecycle from something with a longer one. This skill looks for
the specific patterns that cause leaks, not for general "code smells."

**Output format.** Use the shared Bug Report Format from the dispatcher (`android-bug-hunting-dispatcher`).
Fields: Severity, Category, Location, Effort, Confidence, Description, Impact, Evidence,
Recommended Fix, Confidence Rationale.

---

## Step 1 — Scope

```bash
# Identify Android components and view-handling code
grep -rEln "extends? (Activity|FragmentActivity|AppCompatActivity|Fragment|Service|\
ContentProvider|BroadcastReceiver)|: (Activity|FragmentActivity|AppCompatActivity|Fragment|\
Service|ContentProvider|BroadcastReceiver)\b" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .

# Singleton patterns
grep -rEln "object \w+|companion object" --include="*.kt" .

# Anything View-shaped
grep -rEln "ViewBinding|DataBinding|findViewById" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

---

## Step 2 — Run each detector

---

### D1 — Static / `object` / `companion object` field holding `Context`, `Activity`, `View`, or `Fragment`

**Pattern.**

```bash
grep -rEn "^\s*(private |internal |public )?\s*(var|val)\s+\w+\s*:\s*\
(Context|Activity|FragmentActivity|AppCompatActivity|Fragment|View|TextView|Button|\
ImageView|RecyclerView)\b" --include="*.kt" .
```

For each hit, check whether it sits inside `object X { … }` or `companion object { … }`,
or is a `static` field in Java.

**Why it's a bug.** Singletons live for the whole process. Holding an `Activity` or `View`
reference there leaks the entire view hierarchy on every rotation. Holding a `Context` is
fine *only* if it's the application context — almost never enforced in code.

**Severity.** Critical when the field is an `Activity` or `View`. High for `Context` if
it might be non-application. Medium for `Fragment`.

**Recommended fix.** Either remove the singleton-state pattern, or store
`applicationContext` only. For UI references, scope to the lifecycle owner.

---

### D2 — Singleton accepting `Context` without `.applicationContext`

**Pattern.** `class Foo private constructor(context: Context) { … }` followed by usage
that does not call `.applicationContext` on the passed context.

```bash
grep -rEnB1 -A5 "fun getInstance\(.*Context|companion object.*Context" --include="*.kt" .
```

For each hit, look for `context.applicationContext` inside the singleton's storage logic.
If absent, flag it.

**Why it's a bug.** Activity passes `this` to `Foo.getInstance(this)` → singleton retains
Activity → rotation leaks Activity.

**Severity.** Critical.

**Recommended fix.**

```kotlin
class AnalyticsManager private constructor(context: Context) {
    private val appContext = context.applicationContext  // ← critical
    // …
}
```

---

### D3 — Fragment ViewBinding accessed after `onDestroyView`

**Pattern.** Fragment has a `_binding` and `binding` getter, but functions outside
`onCreateView`/`onViewCreated` access `binding!!` without checking `_binding == null`,
or there's no nulling-out in `onDestroyView`.

```bash
grep -rEn "private var _binding" --include="*.kt" .
```

For each fragment with `_binding`, verify:
1. `onDestroyView` sets `_binding = null`.
2. No coroutine collected on `lifecycleScope` (rather than `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope`)
   accesses `binding`.
3. No callback registered on a long-lived object accesses `binding`.

**Why it's a bug.** Fragment instances outlive their views (e.g. when on the back stack).
`binding` after `onDestroyView` references a destroyed view hierarchy.

**Severity.** Critical if accessed after view destruction (NPE or stale view update).

**Recommended fix.**

```kotlin
private var _binding: FooBinding? = null
private val binding get() = _binding!!

override fun onDestroyView() {
    super.onDestroyView()
    _binding = null
}
```

Also: collect Flows on `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope`, not `lifecycleScope`.

---

### D4 — `LiveData.observe(this, …)` inside a Fragment

**Pattern.**

```bash
grep -rEn "\.observe\s*\(\s*this\s*," --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

For each hit inside a Fragment, the first arg should be `viewLifecycleOwner`, not `this`.

**Why it's a bug.** Fragment outlives its view. Observing with `this` keeps re-running
the observer after `onDestroyView` and re-attaches a stale observer when the view is
recreated, causing duplicate updates.

**Severity.** High. Manifests as ghost UI updates and duplicate event handling.

**Recommended fix.** `viewModel.foo.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { … }`.

---

### D5 — Listeners / receivers / sensors / callbacks registered without unregister

**Patterns and their pairs:**

| Register | Unregister |
|---|---|
| `LocationManager.requestLocationUpdates` | `removeUpdates` |
| `Context.registerReceiver` | `unregisterReceiver` |
| `SensorManager.registerListener` | `unregisterListener` |
| `addOnGlobalLayoutListener` | `removeOnGlobalLayoutListener` |
| `PhoneStateListener.LISTEN_*` | `LISTEN_NONE` |
| `addOnPropertyChangedCallback` | `removeOnPropertyChangedCallback` |
| `setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` (custom owners) | symmetric remove |
| `viewTreeObserver.add*` | symmetric remove |
| `EventBus.register` | `EventBus.unregister` |
| `ContentResolver.registerContentObserver` | `unregisterContentObserver` |

**Search.**

```bash
grep -rEn "register(Receiver|Listener|ContentObserver|OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener)|\
addOn\w+Listener|requestLocationUpdates|EventBus\.getDefault\(\)\.register" \
  --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

For each register call, look in the same class for the symmetric unregister in
`onPause`/`onStop`/`onDestroy`/`onDestroyView` (whichever matches the registration
lifecycle).

**Why it's a bug.** The system holds the listener reference. The listener (often an inner
class or lambda) holds a reference to the Activity/Fragment/View. Result: leak that
persists for the lifetime of the system service.

**Severity.** Critical for system-service registrations (location, sensors, broadcasts).
High for view-tree observers and EventBus.

**Recommended fix.** Add the symmetric call in the matching teardown callback. Consider
DefaultLifecycleObserver or a `lifecycle.addObserver` wrapper that auto-unregisters.

---

### D6 — Inner / anonymous class with implicit outer reference held by long-lived object

**Pattern A — Handler in Activity/Fragment.**

```bash
grep -rEn "object\s*:\s*Handler\(|inner class \w+\s*:\s*Handler" --include="*.kt" .
grep -rEn "new\s+Handler\s*\(" --include="*.java" .
```

If the Handler instance is a non-static inner class, it holds the outer Activity. Posting
delayed messages then leaks the Activity until the messages are processed.

**Pattern B — `postDelayed` with long delay from a non-static inner Runnable.**

```bash
grep -rEn "postDelayed\s*\(" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

For each, check the runnable: anonymous class? lambda capturing `this`? Long delay
(seconds, minutes)?

**Why it's a bug.** Pending messages keep the Handler alive; the Handler keeps the
Activity alive until the delay fires. With a 30s delay, every rotation leaks an Activity
for 30s.

**Severity.** High.

**Recommended fix.**

```kotlin
// Use a static inner class with WeakReference, or:
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    private val handler = Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())
    private val task = Runnable { /* … */ }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        handler.removeCallbacks(task)
        super.onDestroyView()
    }
}
```

---

### D7 — `lifecycleScope` used in a Fragment where `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope` was needed

**Pattern.**

```bash
grep -rEn "(?<!viewLifecycleOwner\.)lifecycleScope\.launch" --include="*.kt" .
```

(If your grep doesn't support look-behind, just grep `lifecycleScope.launch` and inspect
the surrounding context.)

For each hit in a Fragment, ask: does the launched coroutine touch `binding`, `view`,
`requireView()`, or anything view-derived?

**Why it's a bug.** `lifecycleScope` is the Fragment's own scope — it lives across
view destroy/recreate. View references inside it may dangle.

**Severity.** High when view-touching, otherwise Medium.

**Recommended fix.** `viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch { … }` for view-bound
work; `lifecycleScope` only for fragment-scoped work that survives view recreation.

---

### D8 — RxJava `Disposable` not added to a `CompositeDisposable`

**Pattern.** `subscribe(…)` whose return value is ignored, or `Disposable` stored in
a field but never `dispose()`d in the right teardown.

```bash
grep -rEn "\.subscribe\s*\(" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

For each, check whether the return value is `add`'d to a `CompositeDisposable` or stored
and disposed.

**Why it's a bug.** Subscriptions leak the observer, which usually leaks the Activity.
Streams keep emitting (and updating dead UI).

**Severity.** Critical.

**Recommended fix.** Use a `CompositeDisposable` cleared in `onDestroy`/`onDestroyView`.
Consider `RxLifecycle` or migrate to coroutines.

---

### D9 — `bindService` without `unbindService`

**Pattern.**

```bash
grep -rEn "bindService\s*\(" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

For each hit, search the same class for `unbindService`.

**Why it's a bug.** ServiceConnection leaks both the connection callback (which usually
references the binding context) and a binding count for the system. Repeated bind/no-unbind
cycles leak everything.

**Severity.** Critical.

**Recommended fix.** Symmetric `unbindService` in `onStop` (for STARTED-tied bindings)
or `onDestroy`.

---

### D10 — Cursor / Stream / Reader stored in a long-lived field

**Pattern.** A `Cursor`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`, or `Writer` held as a
class property of an Activity/Fragment/Service/ViewModel.

```bash
grep -rEn "(var|val)\s+\w+\s*:\s*(Cursor|InputStream|OutputStream|Reader|Writer)" \
  --include="*.kt" .
```

**Why it's a bug.** These resources are precious; holding them as fields tends to leak
file descriptors and memory. Even when closed, the field reference may keep buffers alive.

**Severity.** High to Medium depending on usage.

**Recommended fix.** Open and close inside a `use { }` block at the call site. If you
truly need a long-lived stream, document it and ensure deterministic teardown.

(Note: this overlaps with `android-bug-hunting-resource-leaks`. Flag here when the *holder* is the lifecycle
violation; flag in `android-bug-hunting-resource-leaks` when the resource lifecycle itself is the issue.)

---

### D11 — `Activity.this` or implicit Activity reference passed to callbacks/threads

**Pattern.** Java `new Thread(new Runnable() { run() { … context … } }).start()` —
the anonymous class holds the outer Activity.

```bash
grep -rEn "new Thread\s*\(" --include="*.java" .
```

In Kotlin: `Thread { … context … }.start()` — same problem when started from an
Activity field initializer or `onCreate` and the thread runs longer than the Activity.

**Severity.** Critical when the thread is long-running.

**Recommended fix.** Use coroutines tied to a proper scope, or pass `applicationContext`
to a static helper.

---

### D12 — `WeakReference` misuse

**Pattern.** Code that creates a `WeakReference<T>` and then holds onto its referent
strongly anyway (assigning `weakRef.get()` to a long-lived field).

```bash
grep -rEn "WeakReference" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" .
```

**Severity.** Medium. Often a sign that the author *thought* about leaks but didn't
finish the job.

**Recommended fix.** Either keep the strong reference and bind it to a lifecycle, or
re-fetch from the WeakReference at use site (and handle `null`).

---

### D13 — `ViewModel` holding `Context`, `Activity`, `View`, or `Fragment`

**Pattern.**

```bash
grep -rEnB1 -A2 "class \w+ViewModel\b" --include="*.kt" .
```

For each ViewModel class body, check fields for `Context`, `Activity`, `View`, `Fragment`.

**Why it's a bug.** ViewModels are deliberately retained across config changes. If the
ViewModel holds a Context other than `Application`, it leaks the Activity.

**Severity.** Critical for `Activity`/`View`. High for raw `Context`.

**Recommended fix.** If the VM truly needs a Context (rare), inject `Application` (via
`AndroidViewModel` or DI). Better: move Context-using logic out of the VM into a
repository or a domain helper that takes Context per call.

---

### D14 — Long-running operations in `onCreate` without scope binding

**Pattern.** Network/database calls in `onCreate`/`onStart` that schedule callbacks but
the callback holds Activity reference.

Inspect Activity/Fragment `onCreate` bodies for callback-style APIs (especially older
Java SDKs) that take a callback parameter without an unregister mechanism.

**Severity.** High when reachable.

**Recommended fix.** Move to ViewModel + coroutines/Flow with proper scope.

## Step 3 — Write the report

Write findings to `<workspace>/findings-lifecycle-leak-hunter.md` in shared Bug Report
Format. Group by detector ID for traceability.

## Notes

- LeakCanary catches many of these at runtime; this skill is the static-analysis
  complement that finds them before the build.
- Reading the *teardown* callback (`onDestroyView`, `onStop`, `onDestroy`) is often the
  fastest way to confirm a leak — every register/observe/post needs a partner there.
- ViewModel fields are a common false-positive source: many ViewModels legitimately hold
  `applicationContext`. Verify before flagging.
